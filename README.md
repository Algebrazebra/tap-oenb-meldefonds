## What is a tax reporting fund?

A tax reporting fund is a fund with a designated tax representative in Austria which reports dividends or dividend-equivalents to the OeKB (Oesterreichische Kontrollbank).

If you are taxable in Austria, it is strongly recommended to exclusively deal with tax reporting funds, because your Austrian bank or broker can calculate the appropriate capital gains tax (KeST) amount based on the reported information. Otherwise, the financial authorities will apply a very unfavorable flat rate tax.
